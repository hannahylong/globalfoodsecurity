# Global Food Security
July 2021

Exploratory data analysis of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations statistics on global food security (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS).

Visualizations highlights:
1. line graphs of statistics over time by region
2. world chloropleth heat maps of the prevalence of severe food insecurity by region for different years
3. scatter plot of GDP per capita vs. prevalence of severe food insecurity by region with fitted trendline
4. bar chart of prevalence of severe food insecurity by country color coded by index of perceptions of likelihood of destabilization of government

Motivation: Interning at Lineage Logistics this summer, the country's largest cold food supply chain company, I was exposed to the many challenges of the agricultural supply chain. Efficiency and food waste are huge problems which do not have easy solutions, and Lineage's core question is: how do we feed the world? Thus, I wanted to learn more about the state of food security in general around the world and found this dataset.
